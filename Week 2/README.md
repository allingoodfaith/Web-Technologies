So at this time I've been to able to figure out how to get chatgpt to spit out what the assignment was wanting. Peronsally I don't mind that as even though I am terrible at coding I'd still rather do it over having some ai do it form me. It will never not fell wrong to have an ai scrape other peoples work just to make my life easier. Every bit of information I learn about how ai gathers data or conducts itself, the more I am put off it as it scrape over art form artists and steals from them. As it uses insane amounts of water and electricity that could amount to a small nation's worth. Even if ai continues to be used in the future, I will take pride in never using if I can.
